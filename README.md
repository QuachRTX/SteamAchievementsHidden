# SteamAchievementsHidden - Web Scraping

#### 
    It helps you find all your remaining hidden achievements.

## How it works
1ยบ Will ask you for two links, one of your achievements and the other of the global achievements of the chosen game.

2ยบ After placing the two links, the browser will analyze the achievements and make a comparison with which ones you have and which ones are missing.

3ยบ Finally it will display the remaining hidden achievements in the console itself and will export a .txt file (text) to your desktop.
